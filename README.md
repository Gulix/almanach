# Almanach

Almanach is a tool to get list of random names, identities and other things (locations, monsters, ... ?). It works as a simple web page without server-side code, and is aimed to computers as well as smartphones & tablets. 

The list of random items is first selected from a category (Identities, ...).

Then, the user can select some tags : those he wants, and those he excludes. Those tags can be, for example, country of origin for the names. 

Then, he selects a dice / value representing the number of shown items : d4 / d6 / d8 / d10 / d12 / d20 / d100. 

Finally, the list is displayed with dive value to randomly choose an entry. Also, there is the possibility to get a pdf output.

## Source of data

The source of the data, for the real identities, is the website [www.generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com)
